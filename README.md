[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/michaelsproul/rust_sequence_trie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/michaelsproul/rust_sequence_trie)

This is a generic Trie implementation that uses a hash map to store child nodes. The Trie is keyed by lists of type `K`, which can be anything implementing `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Hash` and `Clone`. If your keys are explicit lists and you want to be able to store a different value for each element of a key, this might be the data structure for you!

For more information, see the [API documentation][doc].

# Usage

Add `sequence_trie` to your `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
sequence_trie = "*"
```
